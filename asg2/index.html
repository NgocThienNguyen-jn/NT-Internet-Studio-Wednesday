     1. Structured content and semantic HTML are closely related but not the same. Structured content is all about how information is planned and broken into smaller, meaningful chunks that connect to each other, like steps in a recipe or options to pay a ticket. Semantic HTML, on the other hand, is the coding tool that gives those chunks meaning on a webpage. Instead of just styling how text looks, it uses tags to tell both humans and machines what role that piece of content plays.
	 2. These two work best when used together. Structured content provides the organized blueprint of information, and semantic HTML expresses that blueprint in a way that machines can read. For example, when payment options are marked up under a main heading, it signals to search engines or voice assistants that those items belong to one category, making the content clear both visually and logically.
	 3. Having both structured content and semantic HTML is important because people donâ€™t just read web pages anymore; they ask voice assistants, search on Google, and rely on AI to find answers. Without structure and meaning, machines can misinterpret content or skip it altogether, like in the Boston example. With both in place, though, content becomes flexible and trustworthy, able to show up correctly whether on a website, in a search snippet, or spoken out loud by a smart device.
